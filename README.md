An unofficial GUI tool for Pixl's excellent [Unofficial driver for Logitech mice](https://github.com/PixlOne/logiops).

In development. Watch this space!

# Issues

* Config name not updating in DB when user clicks "back" button without focussing out of the textbox first.

* Main page not updating to remove new device when user cancels adding device (but it does delete from DB).

* When a configuration that is "selected" is deleted, another configuration is selected in the DB but not on the page.
